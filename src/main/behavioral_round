Q- Tell me about a time when you faced a problem with a project. How did you solve it?
	- merchant-analytics
		- merchant-analytics
    		- situation:
    			High latency for customer analytics query.
    		- choice/action:
    			- Database partitioning/sharding
    				sharded mid_custid_master[3TB] table on mids.
    				- mid_custid_master_0, mid_custid_master_1, mid_custid_master_2, mid_custid_master_3, mid_custid_master_4, mid_custid_master_5, mid_custid_master_6, mid_custid_master_7, mid_custid_master_8, mid_custid_master_9
    				- use field type as keyword for aggregation fields
    		- outcome:
    		    - each request go to the specified shard/index for searching data
    			- we were able to reduce query latency from 2 minutes to 30 secs.
    			- we were able to reduce ES cost from 32TB to 23TB.


		- situation:
			merchant-analytics was taking too much time to ingestion pipeline.
		- choice/action:
			- I've analysed the problem and found that we are using ES for search and analytics both.
			- Set elasticsearch refresh interval to 1 min. (default 1 sec)
			- I've proposed to use spark for analytics and ES for search only(no agg/computation on elasticsearch).
			- I've implemented the same and it was working fine.
		- outcome:
			- we were able to reduce ingestion time from 2 hours to 30 mins.

	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			merchant-analytics query was having high latency.
		- choice/action:
			- I've analysed the documents modeling and optimised to use keyword type for aggregation fields.
		- outcome:
			- we were able to reduce query latency from 2 minutes to 30 secs.
			- we were able to reduce ES cost from 32TB to 23TB.


Feedback for improvement area from manager:
	- take initiative to monitor junior dev.
	- buffer time for sudden failure scenario

Q- Tell us about a time when you disagreed with your superior.
	- merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			- Need to calculate mid based lat/long and ingest it into KYB team db.
		- choice/action:
			- Proposed to calculate it at our end but not to ingest it into KYB team db.
			- Rather used s3 bucket to store it.
			- KYB team can use it via api call or ingest it according to their need.
		- outcome:
			- loosely couple two systems.

Q- ever refuse rude client(product-manager) requirement?
	- Merchant-analytics
		- situation:
			- requirement to apply transformation on transactional data before ingestion.
		- choice/action:
			- refused to apply transformation on transactional data before ingestion as might be useful for other team.
			- proposed to apply transformation on API side while query.
			- proposed to apply transformation on aggregated data after ingestion.
		- outcome:
			- maintain the data integrity b/w PG and analytics.
			- other system are able to consume the data.

			- Rather used s3 bucket to store it.
			- KYB team can use it via api call or ingest it according to their need.

Q- ever had conflict with peer? how did you handle it.

Q- Tell me about a mistake you made while working as a software developer. How did you handle it?
Q- any scenario where you feel you have failed?
	situation:
		- subscription-engine query data from ES analytics with very high TPS.
	choice/action:
		- modified the existing indices to query data but didn't meet the TPS
		- designed new indices to query data with less aggregation fields.
	- outcome:
		- we were able to meet the TPS.
	- lesson learned:
		- consider all the scenario and dependencies before designing the indices.
		- take some buffer time for sudden failure scenario.
		- get the things done first (nothing is perfect).


Q- Have you ever get negative feedback from your boss? How did you handle it?
	situation:
		- having such experience not monitoring junior dev.
	choice/action:
		- started monitoring junior dev.
		- started taking initiative to monitor junior dev.
	- outcome:
		- got positive feedback from manager.
		- learn how to deal a team

Q- What is your greatest accomplishment?
	- getting enrolled in NIT karnataka without any coaching.
	- announced as galaxy of star for the month jun 2022.
		- worked on purging part of merchant-analytics that was recognised since it saves a lot of cost from ES. 
		- 32TB - 23TB
		- saves around > $2000 per month.
