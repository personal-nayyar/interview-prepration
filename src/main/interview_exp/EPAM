strings strs , group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
Input: strs = ["Eat","Tea","Tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","Tan"],["ate","Eat","Tea"]]

["Eat", "Tea", "Tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"] -> No of anagrams = 3
["Eat", "Tea", "ate"] -> ["Eat", "Tea", "ate"]
["Tan", "nat"] -> ["Tan", "nat"]
["bat"] -> ["bat"]

Given an integer array of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
result = [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

SOLID principles:
	S - Single Responsibility Principle
		- A class should have one and only one reason to change,
		meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
		ex: BankAccount class should only be changed for changes in the bank account,
	O - Open Closed Principle
		- Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
		ex: NotifcationService class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	L - Liskov Substitution Principle
		- Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.
		ex: Square and Rectangle class
	I - Interface Segregation Principle
		- A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use
		or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
		ex: IPrinter, IMachine, IMultiFunctionPrinter
	D - Dependency Inversion Principle
		- It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
		ex: High level module -> Computer, Phone
			Low level module -> HardDisk, Memory, CPU, Screen

Design a microservice API that return firstNonRepeatingCharacter in a string using java 8 streams.
input.chars()
	.mapToObj(c -> (char) c)
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), LinkedHashMap::new, Collectors.counting()))
	.entrySet().stream()
                .filter(entry -> entry.getValue() == 1)
                .map(Map.Entry::getKey)
                .findFirst();
input.chars()
	.mapToObj(c -> (char) c)
	.filter(ch-> input.firstIndexOf(ch) == input.lastIndexOf(ch))
	.findFist();




A -> B
   A -> C (down)
What if C is down for 1 hour, how will you handle it?
	- circuit breaker
	- exponential retry mechanism
	- failover to backup
What if there is some transactional data in C, how will you handle it?
	- Idempotent transaction
	- compensating transaction:
What if there is a transaction including A, B and C, how will you handle it?
	- Distributed transaction mechanism/patter eg. saga 
	- eventual consistency if possible:
	- compensating transaction: revert changes in service if any of the service fails


Immutable class
	- A class that once created, cannot be modified.
	- All the fields of the class are final and private.
	- No setters for the fields.
	- No methods that can change the state of the object.
	- If the class has any references to mutable objects, then they must be cloned in the constructor.
	- If the class has any references to mutable objects, then they must be cloned when returning the object.
	- If the class is extending a mutable class, then all the methods that can change the state of the parent class must be overridden to throw an exception.

Builder Design patter
	- When there are a lot of parameters to be passed to the constructor, it is difficult to remember the order of the parameters.
	- The number of parameters to the constructor can be reduced by using the Builder design pattern.
	- The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that lets us create an object one step at a time.
	- The Builder design pattern involves three classes:
		- The Builder class
		- The Product class
		- The Director class
	- The Builder class is responsible for creating the complex object.
	- The Product class is the complex object that is created by the Builder class.
	- The Director class is responsible for calling the appropriate methods of the Builder class to create the complex object.
	- The Builder design pattern is used to create immutable objects.
	- The Builder design pattern is used to create objects that have a lot of member variables.
	- The Builder design pattern is used to create objects that need parameters to be passed to multiple constructors.

Kafka partition and zookeeper relation
	Kafka partitions are distributed across the cluster and each partition is replicated across multiple brokers.
	Each partition has a leader and zero or more followers.
	Each partition has a unique id called the partition id.
	Each partition has a unique offset called the log offset.
	Each partition has a unique offset called the high watermark.
	Each partition has a unique offset called the low watermark.
	Each partition has a unique offset called the last committed offset.

	Zookeeper is used to store the metadata of the Kafka cluster.
Zookeeper:
	Kafka coordinator
		- meta data
		- service registry of brockers and consumer
		- __consumer_offset
		- leader election

Java8 features
	- Functional Interfaces
	- Lambda Expressions
	- Method References
	- Streams
	- Optional
	- Default Methods
	- forEach() method in Iterable interface

sequential stream vs parallel stream
sequential: 
	- sequential processing
	- single threaded
	- order matters
	- simple and easy debug

parallel stream:
	- parallel processing
	- multi-threaded
	- unordered
	- complexity such as synchronization, race condition etc.


Internal implementation of Concurrent Hashmap
	- ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe version of HashMap.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is a hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is a segmented hash table.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is a hash table.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is guarded by a lock.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is a hash table and each segment is guarded by a lock.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is a hash table and each segment is guarded by a lock and each segment is a separate thread.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is a hash table and each segment is guarded by a lock and each segment is a separate thread and each segment is a separate thread and each segment is a separate thread.
	- ConcurrentHashMap is divided into segments and each segment is a hash table and each segment is guarded by a lock and each segment is a separate thread and each segment is a separate thread and each segment is a separate thread and each segment is a separate thread.

Composition vs abstraction
	Composition:
		- Composition is a way to combine simple objects or data types into more complex ones.
		- Strong relationship
		- Child object does not have its own life cycle
		ex: Car has an engine
	Abstraction:
		- Abstraction is a way to hide the implementation details and show only the functionality to the userSplitWises.
		- Weak relationship
		- Child object has its own life cycle
		ex: Car has a steering wheel

SpringBoot-advantages

@Value vs @Autowired
	- @Value is used to inject values into fields in Spring beans.
	- @Autowired is used to inject beans into fields in Spring beans.

@SpringBootApplication
	- @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
		- @Configuration
			- @Configuration indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.
		- @EnableAutoConfiguration
			- @EnableAutoConfiguration enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism.
		- @ComponentScan
			- @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

Bean scope in springBoot
	- Singleton
	- Prototype
	  - A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.
	  - @Scope("prototype"), @Scope(value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE), @bean(name = "beanName", scope = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
	- Request
	- Session
	- GlobalSession
	- Application
	- Websocket
