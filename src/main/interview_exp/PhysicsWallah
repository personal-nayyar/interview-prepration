Given a zero-inexed array H of height of buildings, number of bricks b and number of ropes r. You start your journey from buiding 0 and move to adjacent building either using rope or bricks. You have limited number of bricks and ropes.
While moving from ith building to (i+1)th building,

if next building's height is less than or equal to the current buiding's height, you do not need rope or bricks.
if next building's height is greater than current buiding's height, you can either use one rope or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
So, question is How far can you reach from 0th buiding if you use bricks and ropes optimally? return index of building till which you can move.

Example 1:

Input : H = [4,2,7,6,9,11,14,12,8], b = 5, r = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: use rope to move from index 1 to index 2.
use 3 bricks to move from index 3 to index 4.
use 2 bricks to move from index 4 to index 5.
use rope to move from index 5 to index 6.
so we can reach at the end of the array using 2 ropes and 5 bricks.
Example 2:

Input : H = [4,2,7,6,9,11,14,12,8], b = 5, r = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: use rope to move from index 1 to index 2.
use 3 bricks to move from index 3 to index 4.
use 2 bricks to move from index 4 to index 5.
so we can reach at index 5 using 1 ropes and 5 bricks.

- ACID properties
	- Atomicity
		- Either all or none of the transaction is executed
	- Consistency
		- Data is consistent before and after transaction
	- Isolation
		- Concurrent transactions do not affect each other
	- Durability
		- Once transaction is committed, it is permanent
- CAP theorem
	- Consistency
		- All nodes/databases see the same data at the same time
	- Availability
		- Every request gets processed even if some nodes are down without consistent data guarantees
	- Partition Tolerance
		- System continues to work despite network failures.
	CP: Consistency and Partition Tolerance, but no Availability
		- Example: RDBMS
	AP: Availability and Partition Tolerance, but no Consistency
		- Example: DynamoDB, Elasticsearch
	CA: Consistency and Availability, but no Partition Tolerance
		- Example: Google Spanner


Messaging Queue
 - A messaging queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service.
	- RabbitMQ
CDN
 - geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
 - The primary goal of a CDN is to reduce latency
 - The closer the CDN server is to the user geographically, the faster the content will be delivered to the user.
 - Akamai, Amazon CloudFront
